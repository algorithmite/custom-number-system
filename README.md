# Algorithmite's Custom Number System

### What is this?

I once heard that Chinese children have an easier time learning to count than those in English speaking countries. This isn't because they are inherently smarter but it is due to the numbers being simpler in Chinese than they are in English. Since I heard this I've always thought about how to make an improved counting system in the back of my head. This is my attempt to improve the way we count numbers, time, dates, and any other areas heavily affected by math in modern society.
