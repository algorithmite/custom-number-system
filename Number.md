### Why Make a New Number System?

#### Chinese Inspiration

As stated in the Readme, I once heard that Chinese children have an easier time learning to count than those in English speaking countries. This isn't because they are inherently smarter but it is due to the numbers being simpler in Chinese than they are in English.

Specifically Chinese numbers are simpler in 2 ways:
1. Chinese numbers are shorter and easier to say.
2. Chinese Counting does not have the same irregular numbers as English. (We say 21 twenty one so why not 11 tenty one)

So eliminating these two issues should be fairly straightforward. Simply rename the characters 0 - 9 as single syllable words and ignore any irregularities in counting.

#### A Step Further

Why not take this a step further? If I were to create a number system that I would be happy using what would that look like?

As it stands this solves a couple of issues with our current number system but there are more opportunities to improve. I'd also like to make this number system :

1. Base Agnostic (At least able to express bases within the system easily)
..* Currently we refer to other bases by the base 10 counterpart (Base 10 or Decimal, Base 2 or Binary, Base 16 or Hexadecimal, etc.)
..* This can be accomplished by creating new number characters that are a function of the base being used or by creating pronunciations that allow for any base to be expressed. Both of these options will be explored more later.

2. Consistent
..* Currently the characters used are based on a varied history from multiple counting systems. This makes for meaningful characters that are not uniform. (1 and 7 look similar if drawn quickly, 6 and 9 are just rotated versions of the other, some characters are similar to english letters, etc.)
..* This can be accomplished by creating new characters based off of a function of some sort rather than from historical precedent.
