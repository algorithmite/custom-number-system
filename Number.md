### Why Make a New Number System?

As stated in the Readme, I once heard that Chinese children have an easier time learning to count than those in English speaking countries. This isn't because they are inherently smarter but it is due to the numbers being simpler in Chinese than they are in English.

Specifically they are simpler in 2 ways:
1. Chinese numbers are shorter and easier to say.
2. Chinese Counting does not have the same irregular numbers as English. (We say 21 twenty one so why not 11 tenty one)

So eliminating these two issues should be fairly straightforward. Simply rename the characters 0 - 9 as single syllable words and ignore any irregularities in counting.
